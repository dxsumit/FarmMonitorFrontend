# FarmMonitorFrontend
Front-End App

This is the front-end App of the product name "FarmMonitor".
FarmMonitor is a concept product which is designed to solve some of the farming related problems.

<b> Statement </b>

The solution we propose is to monitor real-time farm conditions and use that information to help the farmer produce a better yield . FarmMonitor will collect data from the vicinity, analyze the collected data and send it to the farmer's mobile phone.
FarmMonitor will keep track of the acidity of the soil, moisture content, temperature, humidity present in the air and will also be on the lookout for any potential anomaly. If any potential content is out of order for that particular crop FarmMonitor will also suggest potential steps to be taken in order to fix the condition.

In the next phase we have plan to add functionality so that irrigation is linked to the moisture content tracker directly, without any human intervention.
With the help of FarmMonitor a farmer will be able to manage his farm in an effective way.


<b> About the front-end App </b>

This App is built over React Native. It shows real time data coming from farm vicinity where product is placed. 
App is getting real time data from a Firebase API; Product is sending real time data to the Firebase and App is fetching it through the API. For better clarity of processed data, we are representing it using ‘react-native-cart-kit’ library for graphical representation. 
App also supports language change, for that we are using ‘i18next’ module. <b> [Explore app for more of its features and functionalities] </b>
